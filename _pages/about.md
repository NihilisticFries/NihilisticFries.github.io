I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Physics and Technology](https://physics.whu.edu.cn/),[Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). I'm still learning stuff about physics.

I have some cool classmates who also create their own personal homepages. I think it's neccessary to introduce them to you. [LDepression](https://ldepressi0n.github.io/LDepressi0n.io/)

As a normal student, I don't have any research results yet. But I wrote some notes at [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/mao-ke-xiang-24), you might find something interesting there. Whatever, something wrong with Zhihu happened, which makes the fomulars blur in the app. I'm sorry about that, and I choose to create a personal homepage to save my lecture notes and essays. 

If you are my classmate aiming to check whether your homework is still in my place, please go to ().
