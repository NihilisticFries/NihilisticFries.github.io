如果你是我的同学，是来查看是否有作业还寄存在我这的，可以去[Teaching](https://nihilisticfries.github.io/teaching/)目录下寻找。（点这里也可以）

If you are my classmate aiming to check whether your homework is still in my place, please go to [Teaching](https://nihilisticfries.github.io/teaching/).(click)


I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Physics and Technology](https://physics.whu.edu.cn/),[Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). I'm still learning stuff about physics.

I have some cool classmates who also create their own personal homepages. I think it's neccessary to introduce them to you. [LDepression](https://lfcdepression.github.io)

As a normal student, I don't have any research results yet. But I wrote some notes at [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/mao-ke-xiang-24), you might find something interesting there. Whatever, something wrong with Zhihu happened, which makes the fomulars blur in the app. I'm sorry about that, and I choose to create a personal homepage to save my lecture notes and essays. 

Anyway, after struggling with MathJax and Jelkyll, I finally upload my notes in a satisfying form. You can read them in [Notes](https://nihilisticfries.github.io/notes/), and find my mistakes. The purpose to write notes is to enhance my understangding of the lectures(Feymann learning method, maybe). If they also help you, I will be quite happy!

Whatever, I'm quite busy these days. Too much knowledge to learn! And most of my notes were taken in notebooks, which makes it's a huge work for me to type them into markdown files. I will do it in my free time, maybe. And in this term, I choose to write notes directly using vscode(markdown), which allows me upload them immediately, maybe.

Have a nice day!
